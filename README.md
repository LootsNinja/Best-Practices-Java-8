# Best-Practices-Java-8

The purpose of this repository is collecting best practices and different approaches in software worlds into a single place with giving code examples. Every Section has its own documentations under readMe files to describe the problem or practice and have some code examples to illustrate it more in practice.

:mortar_board: Unsurpsingly different sources are used for creating this content with having some comments my own way.

:telephone_receiver: Please feel free to get in touch with me in case you would like to contribute to improve the repo.
